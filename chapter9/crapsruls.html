		A player rolls two dice. Each die has six faces that contain
		one, two, three, four, five, six, spots, respectively. The 
		sum of the spots on the two upward faces is a calculated. If the
		sum is 7 or 11 on the first throw, the players wins. If the sum is 2, 3, or 12 on th first throw (called "craps"), the player losese (i.e., the "house" wins). If the sum is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 on the first throw, that sum becomes the player's "point."
		To win, you must continue rolling the dice until you "make your point" (i.e., roll your point value). You lose by rolling a 7 before making the point.
